  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 (5-to 6-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound asparagus, ends trimmed and cut into 2-inch segments</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
    <li>3/4 cup whipping cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Place one chicken breast on a cutting board. Cover chicken breast with
      plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet until 3/4-inch thick. Repeat
      with remaining chicken breasts.</li>
    <li>Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a very-large skillet over medium-high heat.
      Add chicken and cook until golden brown and an instant-read thermometer
      inserted into the center of a breast reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C),
      8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway. Remove chicken from the skillet; set aside.</li>
    <li>Add asparagus to the skillet. Cook over medium-high, until bright green
      and crisp tender, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove asparagus from
      the skillet; set aside.</li>
    <li>Juice half of the lemon (about 1 1/2 tablespoon juice) and slice the
      remaining half in wedges.</li>
    <li>Add lemon juice, whipping cream, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and
      Italian seasoning to the skillet</li>
    <li>Simmer over medium-high, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon
      to release any browned bits, 2 minutes. Season with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt
      and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</li>
    <li>Add chicken and asparagus back into the skillet. Simmer until heated through
      and sauce reaches desired consistency, about 1 minute. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
  </ol>
